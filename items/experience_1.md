### Starting My Own Company



For my company, I took sports photos and did photoshoots for individuals and families. I started my photography company in the fall of 2023 and have been doing that since then. I really liked that I was able to work for myslef and make money to take care of myslef. My favourite memory was my first ever sports photoshoot because it got a lot of attention for my business. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the waiting period for me to get my first paid shoot, I almost gave up! <br /> I give this experience an A. it was great!
